## The Problem
People who are obsessed with a book often want to read it constantly, which is why they also enjoy reading fan fiction.
 
- Problem #1: People can't access new chapters because they are not written yet.
- Problem #2: In the fanfiction community, because it is a free platform sometimes writers stop uploading after some time even the fanfiction is successful.
- Problem #3: People cannot write fiction that will satisfy them to read if they haven't developed the writing skills.
- Problem #4: Completely untapped global 100M+ GenZ communities for global brands

## MeSu AI: How it works?

### Concept: Control your own plot
>  People can create their own fiction.

### Technology Stack: 

Various AI tools: 
- Google AI Studio
- Midjourney

Sponsored tools:
- Venice AI for image generation,
- Venice AI Reasoning model for data preprocessing, plot fine tuning, and prediction
- FLock.AI to fine tune a GenAI model for fan fiction, and brand matching, maintaining author's creative intent and best brand / plot matching: using DeepSeek R1 GRPO - Group Relative Policy Optimization, with rewarding functions using BLEU, Perplexity, ROGUE-1/2/L ...

## Business Model: 
- Brands grant us their (new) products info and target audience.
- MeSu AI analyzes the existing stories, personalities of the main characters, finding the best fit Brands to embed.
- Mesu AI then generates the next chapter of the story with subtle embedded brands IP, fusing brands IP and story scenes, characters together, maintaining original author's creative intent.

### Smooth Process and UI / UX
- Upload a pdf (the story they want to read next chapter now) and ask MeSu AI to understand the characters and the writing style.
- As the next step, they give a direction on what they want from the next chapter for our AI to write the chapter.
- They will choose the genre and control the plot while having a satisfying reading experience.

## Solutions:
- Solution 01: People will be able to create their own fiction and read it without having to wait
- Solution 02: People can engage with the community like AO3 and share their work with each other, creating a community sense.
- Solution 03: They can choose how the characters look and once they have chosen the character, they can create and share images of the characters and story scenes with each other.
