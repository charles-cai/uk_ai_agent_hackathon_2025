# MeSu AI on Cartoon in International Marketing for GenZ / α

## 1. Re‑frame the Theme → an AI‑for‑Science Problem

| Current focus                                | AI‑for‑Science framing                                                                                                                                                  | Why it matters                                                                                                                                                              |

| Adoption of Ne Zha, K‑pop, anime among Gen Z / α | Cross‑cultural media diffusion model: build multimodal AI systems that predict and optimise how narrative, artistic and marketing choices drive adoption of animated IPs across cultures | • £ 200 bn global animation market<br>• Studios waste millions on failed launches; better predictions accelerate cultural exports and reduce campaign waste                 |
| Manual consumer research & localisation      | Generative AI co‑pilot for content localisation: LLM + diffusion model that proposes culturally resonant edits (dialogue, colours, music cues) and marketing micro‑campaigns | • Cuts translation/localisation cost & time<br>• Raises success rate of non‑English titles                                                                                 |
| Qualitative surveys & sentiment scores       | Real‑time social graph mining using large‑scale X/Twitter, BiliBili, Weibo, TikTok, Reddit data to model early hype cycles                                                | • Early signal = earlier green‑/red‑lighting of sequels & merchandise lines                                                                                                |


One‑sentence “moonshot”
An autonomous, multimodal agent that ingests storyboards or finished episodes and outputs data‑driven, culture‑specific edit & go‑to‑market playbooks—shrinking the gulf between creative studios and global audiences.


## 2. Select an Encode Application Path

|  Path | Pros | Cons | Action items |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| A. Join one of the 16 pre‑posted projects (announced 20 Mar 2025) Encode: AI for Science Fellowship | • Less proposal writing• Instant lab home | • Your topic must match their call areas (many are in climate, robotics, neurotech) | Scan the project list → identify any that need multimodal modelling, recommender systems or social‑behavioural prediction; tailor your answers to that specific brief |
| B. Apply with your own project (your cartoon diffusion idea) | • Full ownership• Directly leverages your domain edge | • Must convince them it’s “science” and “translatable” | Follow the template on pg 2 of the form; see Section 3 below for ready‑to‑paste blocks |

Given how differentiated your domain knowledge is, Path B is likely stronger—you’ll stand out amid climate‑tech & protein‑folding proposals.

## 3. Ready‑to‑Use Proposal Skeleton (fits the fellowship form)

### Problem (≤ 80 words)
> Global animation studios spend >£1 bn/yr on localisation and marketing with <40 % success when crossing cultural borders. Decisions on plot elements, colour palettes and campaign memes rely on ad‑hoc focus groups. There is no science‑grade model that predicts—which specific narrative, visual or marketing tweaks will trigger adoption in a new culture—early enough to act.

### Solution (≤ 120 words)
> We will build CrossDiff, a multimodal transformer‑diffusion system. Inputs: raw film frames, scripts, soundtrack fingerprints, social graph snapshots. Outputs: (1) adoption probability curves for each target market, (2) ranked edit suggestions (e.g. adjust mythological references, hue shift in key scenes) and (3) auto‑generated micro‑campaign assets. Training data: 3 Tb of historical box‑office receipts, streaming watch‑time, social chatter and localisation metadata across 10 000 animated titles.

### Translation opportunity (≤ 80 words)
> CrossDiff can spin out as a SaaS platform sold to studios (Disney, Sony Pictures Animation), streamers (Netflix, Crunchyroll), agencies, and Asian content exporters. Early pilots yield recurring licence fees; long‑term we capture value‑share on box‑office uplift. Alternative routes: partner with UNESCO Creative Cities for cultural‑heritage diffusion, or license to ed‑tech providers localising animated STEM content.

### Partners / advisors
• King’s College London Digital Humanities Lab (social‑media corpora)
• University of Oxford Internet Institute (computational social science)
• Toei Animation & Light Chaser (industry data feeds)
• The Alan Turing Institute (GPU cluster + ethics board)

### Goals & milestones
| Time | Deliverable | Metric of success |
| -- | -- | -- | 
| 0‑3 mo | Curate multi‑regional dataset; train baseline vision‑text sentiment model | ≥ 70 % F1 on retrospective hit/no‑hit classification |
| 3‑6 mo | Integrate diffusion‑based content‑edit recommender; run closed beta with 1 studio | 15 % forecast error reduction vs studio baseline |
| 12 mo | Public demo + 2 paying pilots; draft spin‑out term sheet | ≥ 3 LOIs signed |

### Resources needed
• 100 × A100‑GPU‑hours/month (AWS or Turing cluster)
• APIs for TikTok, X, BiliBili (≈ £12 k/yr)
• Legal counsel for data licensing + IP assignment

### Moonshot outcome
Cut localisation time from 12 months → 6 weeks and double cross‑border hit rate; enable day‑zero simultaneous global releases of culturally tailored versions.

## 4. Answering the “All Applicants” Short‑Answer Questions
| Prompt (100‑150 w) | Angle to hit | 
| -- | -- |
| Who are you? | Bridge two worlds: (i) rigorous marketing researcher at KCL, (ii) self‑taught ML builder hungry to translate culture into code. End with your personal mission to democratise global storytelling. |
| Tech achievement | If you’ve done sentiment scraping in Python, highlight dataset size, models used (e.g. BERT fine‑tune), metrics, and how insights informed a real campaign. Emphasise iterative debugging and shipping mentality. |
| Cross‑disciplinary teams | Narrate how you worked with animators, marketing execs and data scientists on the Ne Zha case study—translating creative language into hypotheses and statistical tests. Show empathy + communication skill. |
(Draft each in a doc, trim to 120 words for breathing room.)

## 5. Signal “AI Depth” despite a Marketing Degree

1. Show prototype screenshots or a Colab link (even if rough) to prove you can code.
2. Name‑drop specific architectures you intend to use (CLIP, Video‑MAE, ControlNet‑in‑paint).
3. Compute plan: quote concrete GPU hours and a cost table—demonstrates realism.
4. Open to UK relocation: Encode fellows are embedded in UK labs; your current London base is perfect.

## 6. Polish & Submit
Deadline: 30 April 2025 23:59 BST (hard stop) 
Encode: AI for Science Fellowship

Keep answers in plain text—the Typeform often strips formatting.

Ask one of your KCL supervisors to be an academic referee; Encode may call them.


## Final check‑list

- Problem clearly scientific & societally impactful
- AI methodology explicit
- 1‑year pathway to commercialisation
- Milestones quantified
- Word counts respected

Good luck—your unique blend of cultural‑marketing insight × AI makes you a standout candidate.
